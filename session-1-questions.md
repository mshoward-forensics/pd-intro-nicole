1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?
        I want to use it in robotics and my friend say it's cool

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?
        I want my students to have the different versions of their code so if there are errors they can go back to different versions.

3. What are ways that GitHub might help you and your students manage code?
        keep it organized in one location so it is easy to use.  (also, seems like this would work wonders for this zoom classroom environment)
